        I woke up today, <br>
        and walked to school<br>
        I was caught with bad things<br>
        and made a slave (not joking pls help)<br>
        <br>
        I ate some ice cream<br>
        and pooped (It hurt a little)<br>
        I played in a church<br>
        some kid played the abcs<br>
        <br>
        I went home<br>
        and played some star citizen<br>
        now i'm writing thing<br>
        and bout to sleep<br>
